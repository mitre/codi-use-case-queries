# CODI Use Case Queries
This repository contains source code (SQL and R) for select use cases in the Clinical and Community Data Initiative. In particular, it contains code for:

* CODI Use Case 1.4 - Estimate the prevalence by weight category in children between the ages of 2 and 19 years in 2017, 2018, and 2019.
* CODI Use Case 2.1 - Among children aged 2â€“19 years who participated in an intervention in 2017, is intervention dose associated with health outcomes?

Code is partitioned into folders for the relevant actor. The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) should look for code in the folders ending in `DCC`. Data Owners and Data Partners should look in the folders ending in `partner`.

Each folder contains a README which describes requirements, set up and running.

The Use Case Outline in the repository provides a high-level overview of each query.
